# Ruby-Hangman-Game

This game was created from The Odin Project Curriculum. It is a basic hangman game that allows the user to start a new game, or load an existing saved game. 

The save game functionality makes use of File I/O and serialization, which was a first for me. All things considered,  this was a very helpful project for building a strong foundation in File I/O and serialization with Ruby (and YAML).
